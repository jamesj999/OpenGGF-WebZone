# Contributing to OpenGGF

OpenGGF is a Java game engine for research and preservation of classic Mega Drive /
Genesis platform games. The project values ROM accuracy first: physics, rendering,
object timing, audio, and trace replay behavior should match the original games as
closely as the engine can prove.

This file is the short entry point. Deeper contributor docs live in
[`docs/guide/contributing/`](https://github.com/jamesj999/OpenGGF/tree/develop/docs/guide/contributing/).

## What To Work On

Good contributions include:

- ROM-accurate object, badnik, boss, level event, palette, PLC, audio, and rendering fixes.
- Tests that make existing behavior easier to verify.
- Trace replay, rewind, and debugging improvements that preserve the engine's native behavior.
- Documentation that helps future contributors understand a real workflow or parity pitfall.

Current project priority is Sonic 3 & Knuckles vertical-slice parity and release readiness. AIZ
through HCZ remains the primary release slice, but CNZ, MGZ, ICZ, MHZ, and LBZ now have enough
coverage that route blockers, complete-run trace frontiers, and release gates should drive task
selection more than broad checklist work. Check [`ROADMAP.md`](/docs/reference/roadmap), [`CHANGELOG.md`](https://github.com/jamesj999/OpenGGF/blob/develop/CHANGELOG),
[`OBJECT_CHECKLIST.md`](https://github.com/jamesj999/OpenGGF/blob/develop/OBJECT_CHECKLIST), [`S1_OBJECT_CHECKLIST.md`](https://github.com/jamesj999/OpenGGF/blob/develop/S1_OBJECT_CHECKLIST),
and [`S3K_OBJECT_CHECKLIST.md`](https://github.com/jamesj999/OpenGGF/blob/develop/S3K_OBJECT_CHECKLIST) before choosing a larger task.

## Legal And Asset Rules

Do not commit ROM files, ripped sprites, ripped music, screenshots containing copyrighted game art,
or other copyrighted game data. OpenGGF loads runtime data from user-supplied ROMs; contributors
need their own legally obtained ROMs for local testing.

Runtime assets must come from the ROM through the engine's ROM-loading pipeline. Do not add
fallbacks that read gameplay asset bytes from `docs/` disassembly/reference trees. Those files are
for research, labels, and offset discovery only.

The repository is licensed under GPLv3. By submitting a contribution, you agree that your changes
are offered under the same license unless the maintainers explicitly agree otherwise.

## Development Setup

Start with:

- [Developer Setup](/docs/guide/contributing/dev-setup)
- [Architecture Deep Dive](/docs/guide/contributing/architecture)
- [Testing](/docs/guide/contributing/testing)

Minimum requirements:

- JDK 21 or later.
- Maven 3.8 or later.
- OpenGL 4.1+ for running the engine window.
- Optional local ROM files for ROM-dependent tests and gameplay.

Build and test:

```bash
mvn package
mvn test
```

Run the built jar:

```bash
java -jar target/OpenGGF-0.6.prerelease-jar-with-dependencies.jar
```

Maven output is quiet by default through the Maven Silent Extension. Use `-Dmse=off` when you need
full logs:

```bash
mvn -Dmse=off test
```

## Accuracy Rules

When porting behavior from a disassembly, cite and model the ROM behavior rather than matching a
single observed symptom.

- Per-game physics differences must be gated by semantic feature flags, usually on
  `PhysicsFeatureSet`. Do not add game-name branches in shared physics code.
- Trace fixes must not branch on zone id/name, route, frame number, or a known failing trace. Model
  the ROM state that drives the branch: object id/routine, status/control bits, frame counter,
  physics profile, event flag, subtype, or data-driven condition.
- Trace data is comparison-only diagnostic input. Do not hydrate or sync engine state from trace
  frame data in committed test or engine code.
- ROM `x_pos` / `y_pos` map to `getCentreX()` / `getCentreY()` in the engine. `getX()` / `getY()`
  are top-left sprite bounds.
- Object art, mappings, DPLCs, animation scripts, PLC data, and runtime bytes must be ROM-backed.

For trace work, read [Trace Replay Testing](/docs/guide/contributing/trace-replay) before making
changes.

## Architecture Rules

Follow the existing provider and service architecture:

- Non-object code should use `GameServices`, explicit dependencies, or providers.
- Object instances should use injected `ObjectServices`; do not call manager singletons from object
  code.
- Do not call `services()` from object constructors unless the class is created through an explicit
  construction-context path.
- Spawn child runtime objects through `spawnChild(...)`, `spawnFreeChild(...)`, or an existing
  lifecycle helper. Direct `ObjectManager.addDynamicObject(...)` is for documented bridge code.
- New object behavior should prefer shared contracts such as `ObjectControlState`,
  `ObjectPlayerQuery`, `ObjectPlayerParticipationPolicy`, `ObjectLifetimeOps`, and canonical
  profiles under `com.openggf.game.profiles.*`.
- Gameplay-path tile edits should route through `ZoneLayoutMutationPipeline` or a
  `LevelMutationSurface`, not direct map writes.
- IDs above the VDP's 11-bit pattern range must render through the virtual pattern ID path.

- [Tutorial: Implement an Object](/docs/guide/contributing/tutorial-implement-object)
- [Adding Bosses](/docs/guide/contributing/adding-bosses)
- [Adding Zones](/docs/guide/contributing/adding-zones)
- [Audio System](/docs/guide/contributing/audio-system)
- [Rewind System](/docs/guide/contributing/rewind-system)

## Testing Expectations

All new or updated tests must use JUnit 5 / Jupiter. Do not add JUnit 4 tests, rules, runners, or
`org.junit.*` imports.

Use the narrowest useful verification:

- Unit tests for local logic.
- `HeadlessTestFixture` / headless integration tests for physics, collision, object, and level
  behavior.
- ROM-gated tests with `@RequiresRom` when real ROM data is necessary.
- Trace replay tests for parity-sensitive movement, object timing, spawn timing, collision, and
  route behavior.

When a trace frontier moves, regresses, or a trace sweep is used to choose the next target, update
[`docs/TRACE_FRONTIER_LOG.md`](https://github.com/jamesj999/OpenGGF/blob/develop/docs/TRACE_FRONTIER_LOG) in the same change.

## Branches, Commits, And Documentation

Use focused branches from `develop`:

- `feature/ai-...` for new features.
- `bugfix/ai-...` for fixes.

Tracked git hooks and CI enforce commit-message trailers on non-`master` branch commits. Maven
installs the hooks during `validate`; if you commit before building, run:

```bash
git config core.hooksPath .githooks
```

Do not bypass hooks with `--no-verify`.

The trailer block records whether related documentation was updated or intentionally skipped:

```text
Changelog: updated|n/a
Guide: updated|n/a
Known-Discrepancies: updated|n/a
S3K-Known-Discrepancies: updated|n/a
Agent-Docs: updated|n/a
Configuration-Docs: updated|n/a
Skills: updated|n/a
```

A `feat`, `fix`, or `perf` commit that touches `src/main/` must either update
[`CHANGELOG.md`](https://github.com/jamesj999/OpenGGF/blob/develop/CHANGELOG) or justify the skip, for example:

```text
Changelog: n/a: test-only helper
```

See [Documentation And Branch Policy](/docs/guide/contributing/documentation-policy) for the
human-facing policy details.

## Pull Request Checklist

Before opening a PR:

- Rebase or merge from current `develop` if your branch is stale.
- Confirm no ROM files or copyrighted game assets are staged.
- Run the focused tests for the changed area and include the commands in the PR description.
- Run broader regression tests when touching shared physics, object lifecycle, rendering, audio,
  rewind, trace replay, or runtime ownership.
- Update `CHANGELOG.md`, guide docs, configuration docs, known-discrepancy docs, and trace frontier
  logs where the change requires it.
- Explain ROM citations or parity reasoning for gameplay behavior changes.
- Call out known limitations or intentional discrepancies instead of hiding them in implementation
  details.

Keep PRs focused. Avoid unrelated refactors unless they are necessary to make the requested change
safe and understandable.
